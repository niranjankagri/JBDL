# Java Backend Development - Spring Boot, Microservices with AI

[![Tests](https://github.com/niranjankagri/java-backend-development/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/niranjankagri/java-backend-development/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

My work for the Java backend course (JBDL, Java Backend Development Live), session by session: from
core Java to Spring Boot, microservices and AI tools. Every topic has a README; topics with code
explain it and link to the classes, and every example is checked by tests.

One session is added per day, each in its own pull request.

## Layout

```
pom.xml                          parent: Java version, dependency versions, compiler + test settings
session-NN-<name>/
  README.md                      the session: topics, what you can do after it, how to run
  topics/NN-<topic>/README.md    one README per topic; topics with code explain it and link to it
  pom.xml, src/                  only for sessions with code (each is a Maven module)
.github/workflows/tests.yml      CI: build + all tests on JDK 17 and 25 for every pull request
```

## Run it

Needs Java 17 or newer. Maven itself is not needed: the Maven Wrapper downloads a checked version.

```bash
./mvnw verify                                       # every session: compile (warnings are errors) + tests
./mvnw -pl session-01-java-architecture-oop verify  # one session
```

On Windows use `mvnw.cmd`.

## The 2024 code

My original 2024 exercises are kept unchanged in the history: commit
[`4b8754b`](https://github.com/niranjankagri/java-backend-development/tree/4b8754b). They were upgraded
(tests, fixes) and now live in the session they belong to:

| 2024 file(s) | Now | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| `Car.java`, `Quiz.java`, `Main.java`, `inheritance/*` | Session 1 | Builder for the 7-property car; quiz answers tested; `SuperCar.getInfo()` builds on `super.getInfo()`; factory |
| `functionalinterface/*`, `collections/*` | Session 3 | Collections examples ignored every return value; `FunctionalInterface` hid `java.lang.FunctionalInterface`; duplicate `MetroEngine2` merged |
| `multithreading/*` | Session 5 | **Bugs fixed:** `ThreadJoin` never started its worker thread; `RunnableInterface` never used its `Runnable` |
